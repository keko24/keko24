Hi, My name is Andrej and I'm a sophomore Computer and Electrical Engineering Student from North Macedonia. 
I'm interested in Game Developement, Computer Graphics, AI, Theoretical CS, Blockchain, Electronics, Robotics, and Mathematics.
I'm currently learning fullstack web developement with Javascript by following The Odin Project, while I wouldn't like to work as a web developer I think it is rather useful thing to know.
