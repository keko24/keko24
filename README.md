Hi, My name is Andrej and I'm a freshman Computer and Electrical Engineering Student from North Macedonia. 
I'm interested in AI, Cryptography, Security, Competitive Programming, Cryptocurrencies, Blockchain, Electronics and Mathematics.
I'm currently learning web developement with Ruby on Rails, while I wouldn't like to work as a web developer I think it is rather useful thing to know.
Also I do competitive programming as a hobby but I'm still a beginner.
