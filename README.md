Hi, My name is Andrej and I'm a sophomore Computer Engineering Student from North Macedonia. 
I'm interested in AI, Theoretical CS, Computer Graphics, Blockchain, Electronics, Robotics, and Mathematics.
I'm currently learning fullstack web developement with Javascript by following The Odin Project, while I wouldn't like to work as a web developer I think it is rather useful thing to know.
